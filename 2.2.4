# Add a class method to your Car class that calculates and prints any car's
# average gas mileage (miles per gallon). You can compute the mileage by
# dividing the distance traveled (in miles) by the fuel burned (in gallons).

# Solution:

class Car:

    def __init__(self, model, year, colour):
        self._model = model
        self._year = year
        self._colour = colour
        self.speed = 0

    @classmethod
    def gas_mileage(cls, gallons, miles):
        mileage = miles / gallons
        print(f'{mileage} miles per gallon')

# Example:

Car.gas_mileage(13, 351)
