# Create a Car class that meets these requirements:
# * Each Car object should have a model, model year, and colour provided
#   at instantiation time.

# * You should have an instance variable that keeps track of the current
#   speed. Initialise it to 0 when you instantiate a new car.

# * Create instance methods that let you turn the engine on, accelerate,
#   brake, and turn the engines off. Each method should display an appropriate
#   message.

# * Create a method that prints a message about the car's current speed.

# * Write some code to test the methods.

# Solution:

class Car:

    def __init__(self, model, year, colour):
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.colour = colour
        self.speed = 0
    
    def engine_on(self):

        print("Engine is turned on!")

    def accelerate(self, number):

        self.speed += number
        print(f"Speeding up {number} kmph!")

    def brake(self, number):

        self.speed -= number
        print(f"Slowing down {number} kmph!")


    def engine_off(self):
        self.speed = 0
        print("Engine is turned off!")


    def get_speed(self):

        print(f'Current speed is {self.speed} kmph.')

# Example:

ferrari = Car('Ferrari', 2024, 'Red')
ferrari.engine_on()
ferrari.get_speed()
ferrari.accelerate(10)
ferrari.get_speed()
ferrari.brake(2)
ferrari.get_speed()
ferrari.engine_off()
ferrari.get_speed()
