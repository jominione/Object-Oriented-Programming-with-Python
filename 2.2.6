# Going back to your solution to exercise 1, refactor the code to replace
# any methods that can be converted to static methods. Once you have done
# that, ask yourself whether the conversion to a static method makes sense.

# Solution:

class Car:

    @staticmethod
    def engine_start():
        print('The engine is on!')

lumina = Car('chevy lumina', 1997, 'white')
Car.engine_start() # The engine is on!

# Changing lumina.engine_start() to Car.engine_start() wasn't entirely 
# necessary; the code would work either way.

# Changing engine_start to a static method in this class is probably not 
# a great idea. While the method doesn't need self or cls, a real engine_start 
# method would almost certainly need access to the attributes of the Car 
# instance; turning an engine on takes more than just saying it is on.

# Note that you might also try converting gas_mileage from question 4 to a 
# static method. However, we've asked you to update the solution to question 1.
