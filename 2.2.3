# Add a method to the Car class that lets you spray paint the car a specific
# colour. Don't use a setter method for this. Instead, create a method whose
# name accurately describes what it does. Don't forget to test your code.

# Solution:

class Car:

    def __init__(self, model, year, colour):
        self._model = model
        self._year = year
        self.colour = colour
        self.speed = 0

    def spray_paint(self, colour):
        self.colour = colour
        print(f"Your {colour} paint job looks great!")

# Examples:

ferrari = Car('Ferrari', 2024, 'Red')

ferrari.spray_paint('blue')
