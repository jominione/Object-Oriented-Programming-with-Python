# How do we create a class and an object in Python?

# Write a program that defines a class and creates two objects from that
# class. The class should have at least one instance variable that gets
# initialised by the initialiser.

# What class you create doesn't matter provided it satisfies the above
# requirements.

# Solution:

class Snake:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

# Example:

snaky = Snake('Snaky')

anaconda = Snake('Anaconda')
