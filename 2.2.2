# Using decorators, add getter and setter methods to your Car class so you
# can view and change the colour of your car. You should also add getter
# methods that let you view but not modify the car's model and year. Don't
# forget to write some tests.

# Solution:

class Car:

    def __init__(self, model, year, colour):
        self._model = model
        self._year = year
        # Because colour has a setter decorator does not need to be defined 
        # starting with _.
        self.colour = colour     
        self.speed = 0

    # Omitted code

    @property
    def colour(self):
        return self._colour

    @colour.setter
    def colour(self, colour):
        self._colour = colour

    @property
    def model(self):
        return self._model

    @property
    def year(self):
        return self._year

# Examples:

ferrari = Car('Ferrari', 2024, 'Red')
print(ferrari.model)
print(ferrari.year)
print(ferrari.colour)

ferrari.colour = 'Blue'

print(ferrari.colour)
